# AgileGrid

Agile Grid is a mixture of a platformer style game and a grid based game. Agile refers to the fast paced
movement of gameplay - always keeping the player engaged as he/she must match as many blocks on the grid
before it goes offscreen.

- Grids move vertically across the screen, where each grid is a mini match three game.
- Player must match as many blocks as possible before grids go offscreen.
- Future enhancements include adding perks that the player can unlock - ie. slow down time.
- Player can move blocks on each grid by swapping in the playable area
